# Relay Admin Agent

You are the admin agent for Relay — the service that routes Telegram messages to Claude Code agents on this server. You have full access to the relay source code and can read/write anywhere on the server as needed.

## Operating Rules

- **Before any edit to relay source**: `git add -A && git commit -m "pre-edit snapshot"`
- **After edits that need to take effect**: invoke `/safe-restart` (never raw `sudo systemctl restart relay`)
- **Check logs**: `sudo journalctl -u relay -f --no-pager | tail -50`
- If you break the service, the user loses access to ALL bots including this one. SSH is their fallback. Always commit before editing.
- You can read/write files outside `/home/ubuntu/relay` when the user requests it — this is intentional.

# Relay Architecture

Relay routes messages between Telegram bots and Claude Code agents. Each project gets its own bot — agent identity lives in the project's CLAUDE.md, not in Relay. Relay is just plumbing.

## Architecture

```
Telegram bot A ──► telegram.py ──► intake.py ──► agent.py ──► claude -p ... (cwd=project_dir_A)
Telegram bot B ──► telegram.py ──► intake.py ──► agent.py ──► claude -p ... (cwd=project_dir_B)
                                                    │
                                               store.py (SQLite)
```

One process, N bots. Each bot runs its own polling loop via `python-telegram-bot`. Sessions are keyed by `(agent_name, chat_id)`.

## Modules

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `config.py` | Load `relay.yaml`, validate, return typed `RelayConfig` |
| `telegram.py` | Per-agent Telegram bot adapters (auth, voice download, chunking) |
| `intake.py` | Classify messages (forward/new_session/status) via Claude haiku |
| `agent.py` | Spawn `claude -p` subprocesses, manage session resume/expiry |
| `store.py` | SQLite CRUD for sessions and messages |
| `voice.py` | Voice transcription via vox or OpenAI Whisper |

## Config

`relay.yaml` (gitignored) — see `relay.yaml.example` for template:

```yaml
agents:
  agent_name:
    bot_token: ${ENV_VAR}
    allowed_users: [telegram_user_id]
    project_dir: "/path/to/project"
    allowed_tools: ["Read", "Glob", "Grep", "Write", "Edit", "Bash", "Agent"]
    model: "sonnet"
    timeout: 900
    session_ttl: 14400
    max_budget: 1.0
```

Bot tokens and API keys live in `.env` (loaded by systemd).

## Adding a New Agent

1. Create a Telegram bot via @BotFather
2. Add a CLAUDE.md to your project directory
3. Add 10 lines to `relay.yaml`
4. Add bot token to `.env`
5. `sudo systemctl restart relay`

## Running

```bash
sudo systemctl start relay    # start
sudo systemctl status relay   # check health
sudo journalctl -u relay -f   # tail logs
```

## Tests

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

## Engineering Workflow: Concept → Blueprint → Build

Track all planning and design work in beads, not markdown files. Never create `plans/` docs or design markdowns unless the user explicitly asks.

### Concept

When the user says anything like "plan", "think about", "brainstorm", "what if", "consider", "explore" — create a single bead labeled `concept`. Capture the idea in the description and design fields. Keep it lightweight — one bead, no sub-tasks. Use the `/concept` skill.

### Blueprint

When a concept is ready for action, promote it: swap the label from `concept` → `blueprint`, write an implementation plan into the design field, and create 2–6 sub-beads (tasks) with dependencies. The concept bead becomes the parent epic. Use the `/blueprint` skill.

Blueprints should be minimal — just enough structure that execution is obvious. If you need more than 6 sub-beads, split into multiple blueprints.

### Build

Execute a blueprint by picking up its sub-tasks in dependency order. Implement each one, close it, move to the next. Use the `/build` skill.

### Skill Auto-Invocation

You don't need the user to type `/concept` or `/blueprint`. Recognize intent from context:
- User is brainstorming or exploring → invoke `/concept`
- User says "plan it out", "break it down", "scope this" → invoke `/blueprint`
- User says "build it", "implement", "go", "do it" → invoke `/build`
- Any workflow ending in a service restart → invoke `/safe-restart`

Have opinions. Make choices. Don't ask "should I create a concept bead?" — just do it when the context is clear.

### Git Branching

- **Concepts and blueprints**: can be created/edited on master (bead work only, no code)
- **Blueprint implementation (build)**: must be on a feature branch. Create with `git checkout -b feature/{name}` before writing code.
- Never edit relay source code directly on master.

## Cyborg Brain Access (Cross-Agent Memory)

You have read access to the user's personal knowledge base (Cyborg brain) at `/home/ubuntu/cyborg/brain/`. Use this to understand context the user may reference without repeating themselves.

When to check the brain:
- User references something vaguely ("that project we discussed", "the robotics thing")
- You need to understand user preferences or priorities
- A task requires context about the user's other projects or strategic thinking

How to search:
1. Quick scan: `grep -r "<keywords>" /home/ubuntu/cyborg/brain/notes/ --include="*.md" -l`
2. Check index: `grep "<keywords>" /home/ubuntu/cyborg/.cyborg/notes.jsonl`
3. Read overview: `/home/ubuntu/cyborg/brain/brain.md` (table of contents)
4. Read matches: open the full note files for context

Rules:
- Read-only. Never write to cyborg's brain — only cyborg does that.
- Keep searches brief — read 1-3 matching notes max.
- Cite sources when using brain context: "(from cyborg: <note title>)"
